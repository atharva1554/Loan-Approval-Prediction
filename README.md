## Introduction

Loan approval processes involve assessing various factors such as an applicant's credit history, income, employment status, and other attributes. This project utilizes machine learning models to predict whether a loan will be approved based on these factors, providing a data-driven approach to decision-making.

## Data

The dataset used in this project includes features such as:

- Applicant's Gender
- Marital Status
- Education
- Applicant's Income
- Co-applicant's Income
- Loan Amount
- Loan Amount Term
- Credit History
- Property Area


## Models

We explored several machine learning models to predict loan approval status, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Each model's performance was evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.



## Results

The models' predictions and performance metrics are documented in the `results/` directory. Visualizations such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importance plots are included.


## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/atharva1554/Loan-Approval-Prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Loan-Approval-Prediction
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To explore and use the project, you can run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory. These notebooks cover data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Additionally, the `scripts/` directory contains Python scripts for specific tasks like data cleaning and model deployment.
